This Project is all about the Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression in Machine Learning.

Features:

- Loading and exploring a heart disease dataset.
  
- Performing data preprocessing and feature engineering.
  
- Building a logistic regression model.
  
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix and Classification Report.
  
- The dataset used is assumed to be from a public heart disease dataset, such as the onefrom the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

The notebook uses the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Insights Obtained:

- The accuracy socre of the model is 0.85 which means the model is 85% Accurate.

Classification report:

- True Positives: These are the cases where people are actaully having heart disease and model also predicted correctly - 194.

- True Negatives: These are the cases where poeple dont have heart disease and model also predicted correctly of not having heart disease - 14.

- False Positives: These are the cases where the people actually dont have heart disease but the model predicted incorrectly predicted that they have heart disease - 161.

- False Negatives: These are the cases where the people actually have heart disease but the model incorrectly predicted that they dont have heart disease - 9.
