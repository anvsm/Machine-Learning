This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease using logistic regression. The model is built and evaluated using Python libraries and is intended for exploratory data analysis purposes.
The notebook walks through:

- Loading and exploring a heart disease dataset
- Performing data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Building a logistic regression model
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix and Classification Report

The dataset used is assumed to be from a public heart disease dataset, such as the one from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The notebook uses the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
